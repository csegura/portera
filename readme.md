## Portera

Awesome remote logs for node

#### Motivation

Coronavirus quarantine time at home, brought me to prectice node. I began to do a sample project for the company where I work because it was something that I have in mind for some time ago. The project its like a middleware between our different management software and third part applications, this middleware should contain all bussiness logic necesary by thrird part systems.
This part is more or less completed and I added a GraphQL interface to learn it, after this I have a lot of queries and results from my program that I needed check. Then problem was that I have only my laptop and between code editor and web interface I havenÂ´t enaugh screen to show query logs. Then I thought that I could use my tablet as a remote log viewer, and here is the result !!!
