> bored with console logs? **portera**ðŸš€ provides remote logs for you node apps with an awesome style :).

**portera** has two parts, a library that wrap your console object by default, redirecting the output to **portera** server, its receive your data and serve a web page where you can display an awesome output, just like that

![Sample Web](/docs/portera_web_0-1-0.gif)

## Installation

Install **portera** in your dev environment, or better -g (globally) in your toolbox

```sh
$ npm install portera --save-dev
```

## Use

Whithout any configuration just import **portera** in your project,

```js
const portera = require("portera");

// whithout any configuration
// portera should wrap console
// and use localhost:3001 as default host
portera();
```

Or portera using a more detailed configuration

```js
const portera = require("portera");

// console outputs will be send by portera
// use your own ip:port
portera({
  host: "http://localhost:3001",
  obj: console,
  use: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? [] : null,
});
```

Also you can keep your current console object and create/use a new one

```js
const portera = require("portera");
const debug = {}
portera({
  host: "http://localhost:3001",
  obj: debug,
  performance: 0
});

debug.log(...)
debug.info(...)
```

## Portera configuration

- `host` where portera server is running by default `http://localhost:3001`
- `obj` the object to use by default `console`
- `performance` time in ms to obtain data performance by default 0 that is disabled
- `use` - an optional array with name methods, that should be added or replaced by default if not specified contains all `["log", "info", "warn", "error", "assert", "trace", "btrace", "stack", "dump"]`
- `nouse` - an optional array with the name of methods that should emptyed

You can use portera as development tool and later in other environment select the methods that you want.

```js
const portera = require("portera");
portera({
  use: ["btrace", "stack", "dump"],
  nouse: ["log"]
});

console.dump(...) // portera dump method
console.info(...) // console default method
console.log(...) // will be hidden {}
```

**portera** should use defaults for host, object, and performance and only will be added to console the specified methods in `use` option, default methods from `console` keep untouched except `log` that is is specified in `nouse` will remain hidden. You can mantain this in your code but deactivated.

## Portera server

**portera** server runs on port 3001 by default, you can change this using an argument when execute **portera**, see below. Once running you can open your favorite browser using **portera** address http://<portera_server_ip>:3001

Run portera server

```sh
$ npx portera
```

Once running you will see portera output both in the server console and in the web client. To use the amazing web client you can open your favorite browser using the portera address `http://<portera_server_ip>:3001`

## Portera web client

By default **portera** show three levels of json, you can change this using an argument in the url with the parameter `?l=`. Try others like `?l=0` or `?l=5`

> `http://localhost:3001/?l=2`

_ms_ displayed on the right of the log page are time made between calls in your source program, the time is taken before to emit the event

Current data session are stored in the browser using your local machine storage you can delete this using "clear session" button on top, meanwhile you can clear your screen using "clear" button, but the data will be there next time you reload the page.

## Portera performance monitor

I added it to show some cpu & memory data that node offers via proccess. To reach performance data add `/performance` to your server url and setup `performance` parameter in portera configuration

> `http://localhost:3001/performance`

![Sample Performance](/docs/portera_performance_0-0-22.gif)

Data is collected each time specified in the `performance` parameter when portera is initialized. Time should be expressd in ms. By default is disabled 0. I recommend values beginning from 1000 (1s)

- `event.loop` the even loop lag in ms
- `cpu.user` cpu user time in ms
- `cpu.system` cpu user time in ms

- `heap` memory used by the heap in megabytes
- `heap.total` memory available in the heap in megabytes

I'm sure that there are great tools to measure performance for node applications, it is only a little toy because was paying again. Please check `lib/portera.js` performance function and `bin/public/performance/performance.js` to check how this data is collected and showed. Feel free to comment anything.

### Portera methods

Will have the same behaviour than known original ones.

```js
portera.log(...)
portera.info(...)
portera.warn(...)
portera.error(...)
portera.trace(...)
portera.assert(...)
```

**portera** add some other interesting functions

```js
portera.group(...) // name your groups
portera.stack() // trace showing only functions called previously
portera.dump(...) // dump and object amazing
portera.btrace(...) // better trace - still working on it
```

If no group is specified portera group everything under "portera" group, once a group is specified next calls will be tagged inside of that group while no other is specified.

Inside of portera web you can filter groups using regexp. Enjoy!!

`portera.dump(...)` dump an object to the console try `portera.dump(console)` or `portera.dump(process)`

```js
function add(a, b) {
  console.stack();
  return a + b;
}
console.dump([add]); // to dump a function
```

### Portera server - command line arguments

**portera** server can be launched with command line arguments.

Use `-p` or `--port` to specify a different port
Use `-m` or `--mode` to specify two dirent forms of dispaly data in console `-m awe` by default or `-m normal`. In normal mode json will be valid json, you can copy & paste to use in another place. Awesome output is more readable otherwise json donÂ´t have a valid format.
Use `-s` or `--silent` for silent mode, no console logs.

Sample Console in awe mode by default:

### Upgrade

**portera** is a tool as such I recommend update always to the latest version

```js
npm update -g portera@latest
```

### Motivation

These days I spent more time at home by corona quarantine, time to practice and learn new things. I began to do a sample project in node for the company where I work, it was something that I had have in my mind time ago. The project its a middleware between our different management programs and third part applications, this middleware should contain all bussiness logic necesary by thrird part systems.

When I had this part finished, I was adding a GraphQL interface to learn about it. Then I had a lot of api queries and results from my program and I needed inspect then, to understand how queries were formed and verify the results.

Then I had another problem, it was that I had only my laptop and it have a little screen, between the code editor and browser I didnÂ´t have enaugh screen to show everything. Then I thought that I could use my tablet as a remote log viewer, and here is the result !!!

### Note

As always there are a lot of things to-do. this was a hobby for this days, but if you want to do portera better no doubt in contact with me. I'm novice in node, not programming, this is my second program, I'm willing to learn more ...
