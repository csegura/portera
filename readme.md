## Portera

Awesome remote logs for node

#### Motivation

Coronavirus quarantine time at home, brought me to learn node. I began to do a sample project for the company where I work because it was something that I have in mind for some time ago. The project its like a middleware between our different management software and third part applications, this middleware should contain all bussiness logic necesary by thrird part systems. This part is more or less completed and I would wan add a GraphQL interfece.

Then I thought that I could use my tablet as a remote log viewer, and here is the result !!!
